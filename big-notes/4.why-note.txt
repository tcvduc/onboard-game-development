1. Why year % 4 = 0 && year % 100 !=0 || year % 400 = 0 
was the leap year condition ?

2. Why does n^0 = 1
- n^3 = n x n x n 
- n^n is the product of n x n x ... x n x ...
- So n ^ 0 means we don't have any product of n or
means the product of no numbers at all

3. Why 0 was not an odd number?

4. why nthRoot(x^m) = x^(m/n) ?

5. why n / 0 was error

6. Why do we have f(x) = ax + b equation ?
+ Because it was a foundation for something

7. Why (a - b)(a - b) = a^2 - ab - ab + b^2 ?
