Fact Note

1. 0: Zero is neither positive nor negative
2. {} - empty set is either even number or odd number
3. set vs sequence: 
  + common: elements, terms 
  + difference  
    + sequence: the same elements can appear multiple times
    + sequence: the order does matter
    + set: the same elements cannot appear multiple times 
    + set: the order doesn't matter
4. Can negative number be a prime number?
  + No 
  + Yes 
  + It does not matter
5. Foo and Bar variables relatived to US Army WWII acronym
  + FUBAR - Fucked Up Beyond All Recognition
    + const foo = 1 <=> const fuckedUp = 1
    + const bar = 2 <=> const beyondAllRecognition = 2

6. WAR: Willing, Able, Ready

7. It is easier to understand a measured in minutes and remaining 
seconds than in total seconds.
  + total seconds: 70s
    + shred: 
      + minute: 1m = 60s
      + second: 10s

  + if we don't have hour, minute definition, and only have 
  second then
    + 00:00:00 AM = 0s
    + 00:01:10 AM = 70s
    + Hey, when do you wake up?
      + I woke up at 70s.
  
  + if we have hour, minute, second definition
    + 00:00:00 AM 
    + 00:01:10 AM 
    + Hey, when do you wake up?
      + I woke up at 00:01:10 AM 

8. modulus real life application 
  + calculate hours, days, longer periods of time 
  + calculate coordinate, latitude, longitude

9. because we want to get the exactly location/position 
then coordinate/longitude/latitude definition was born.

10. NASA: The National Aeronautic and Space Administration
