8. math note

8.1. Linear Equation:  ax + b = 0 
+ a = 0 - x = null
+ a != 0 - x = -b / a

8.2. Quadratic Equation: ax^2 + bx + c = 0

- Did you know that when a rocket is launched,
its path is described by a quadratic equation?

+ a = 0 - solveLinearEquation(b,c)

+ a != 0   
  + 2thRoot(b^2 - 4ac) is not a number ? return null
  + 2thRoot(b^2 - 4ac) is a number ? return 
  
  Quadratic formula:
      -b + 2thRoot(b^2 - 4ac)
  x1 = _______________________
                  2a

      -b - 2thRoot(b^2 - 4ac)
  x2 = ________________________
                  2a



8.3. Cubic Equation: ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d = 0



8.4. Quartic Equation: ax^4 + bx^3 + cx^2 + dx + e = 0

8.5. stands for, keywords
+ sqrt: Square Root, 2th Root
+ cbrt: Cube Root, 3th Root

+ then (and only then) means: 
  + if not then then what ?
  + then

+ Formula: Công thức
  + Example: x^2 + (a + b)x + ab = (x + a)(x + b)

+ Factor out
  + Example: Factor out x in x^2 - x
    x^2 - x 
<=> x(x - 1)

+ real root: nghiệm 
  + Example: x - 1 = 0
  - x - 1 = 0 has one real root means: x - 1 = 0
  has one real root and it was x = 1

+ polynomial: Đa thức
  + Example: f(x) = x - 1

+ Thus: Do đó
+ Hence: vì thế
+ Furthermore: Hơn nữa
+ Nevertheless: Tuy nhiên

+ Integrals: tích phân 
  + Tích phân != nguyên hàm
+ : Nguyên hàm 
  + Nguyên hàm != tích phân



+ Calculus: 
  + The branch of mathematics
  + Deals with finding and properties of 
  derivatives (Đạo hàm) and integrals (Tích phân)
  of functions (f(x))
  + Using method `summation of infinities differences`


+ Integrals essence: 
  + Bản chất tích phân là gì? 
    + Là tính diện tích của đường cong đồ thị nằm trong vùng x từ a đến b
  + 

+ Derivative essence: 
  + The rate of the change bellow
    + x change then y change
    + Example:
      + y = 1
      d(y) / dx = d(1) / dx = 0
      -> Because we don't have x in the y = 1
      so the rate of the change is 0
    + Example:
      + y = x - 1
      d(y) / dx 
      = d(x - 1) / dx
      = d(x) / dx + d(-1) / dx
      = 1 + 0
      = 1
      -> Because we have x in the y = x - 1 
      so we have the rate of the change. And
      it was calculated by using derivative formula
        + d(a) / dx = 0  
          + But why one can found this formula ?
            + Answer 1: because one has passionate
            about mathematics, one do math a lot, 
            the problem one meets increasing by the time
            so does it problem level so it comes naturally.
            + Answer 2: god gives one

          + Why should we learn this ?
          
          + Forget about how one found this formula.
 

        + d(x) / dx = 1
      


+ Absolute value: |x|
