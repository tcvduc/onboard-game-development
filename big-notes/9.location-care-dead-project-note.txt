Corpse 1: Get family's members location through mobile phone - mobile app
- Get the person who you care location throught mobile phone - mobile app

App name Ver 1: Location Care
App name Ver 2:
- problem:
+ App Name is too long
+ The word Care is too reveal
-> Solve this using Grab idea: one word - Grab
- some english relative words:
+ location
+ care
+ look
+ mobile phone
+ observe
+ map
+ worry
+ helper stuff to kill somebody
+ a matrix
+ baby learn to do stuff
+ baby learn to join the system
+ Flow
  + stuff move through eye -> eye nerves -> brain nerves
  + look something -> create electrical signal -> brain process system

-> Temporary Result 1: Signal - should use verb for the active in the app essence?
-> Temporary Result 2: Sign

-> Final App Name Ver 2 Result:
What the app name should be? Later

+ App essence ?
  -> look another person location through mobile phone
+ Use verb or noun or another word type?
  ->  use any word type is okay as long as it
  describe the app eseence



- Flow

+ Flow version 1
  + Parent mobile
    + Enter children mobile phone
    + On children mobile, display a request to allow parent
    to get their location

  + Children mobile
    + Enter parent mobile phone
    + On parent mobile, display a request to allow children
    to get their location

+ Flow version 2
  + Sapien A mobile
    + Enter person's phone number who you want to look their
    location:

I. User Experience
  1. What will happens if the app don't have the password field
  and only have phone input field?
    - Cons
    + User may see weird
    + App is not safety (1)
      + If any user got the phone number of another user
      then they can access to the data
        + What if user A got user B data
          + A can got those information:
            + B's phone number, name, address
            + B's location look list
                + Scenario 1: related to friendship
                  + Scenario 1.1: good intention
                    + B is A's friend
                    + B and A in a place where they drink ancohol
                    + B got drunk
                    + A still awake
                    + A want to communicate B's family to let
                    them know B status
                    -> A got B phone then A can do it by using
                    this app, what a beauty scenario!

                    -> B will not be damaged

                  + Scenario 1.2: bad intention
                    + A want to kill B
                    + This is a helper tool for this purpose
                    -> B will be dead or live a life with full of worries
                    + But the truth is if A really want to kill B
                    A will find a way to do this if this tool is not exist
                    for example: buy data from Google, buy data from Facebook,
                    buy data from the trademark devices that B use like
                    phone, television, washing machine, refrigerator, light bubls,
                    wires even home structure system.
                    -> So this is not a reason to stop the remove password field

                  + Scenario 1.3: neither good nor bad intention
                    + Because of the curious A just want to know B
                    app data
                    -> B will not be damaged

                + Scenario 2: related to employer and employee relationship
                  + Scenario 2.1: good intention
                    + A is a company/employer B are employees
                    + A want to know where B is, or just because
                    A want to taste the feeling when we
                    look somebody location through an application
                    -> B will not be damaged

                  + Scenario 2.2: bad intention
                    + A want to control B life
                    -> B will be damaged

                  + Scenario 2.3: good intention
                    + B is a employee who also have A employer location
                    + B want to thank A for the good thing A did
                    -> A,B will not be damaged

                  + Scenario 2.4: bad intention
                    + B is a employee who also have A employer location
                    + B want to harm A for the bad thing A did
                    -> A,B will be damaged

                  -> This app is risky, those sapiens from this
                  relationship to higher consciousness
                  sapiens relationship may not use

                + Scenario 3: Related to company and company relationship
                  + A and B can watch each other location
                  -> There is nothing hurt happen if A and B don't
                  have bad intension


                + Scenario 4: Related to country and country relationship
                  + They will not use

                + Scenario 5: Related to self-self relationship
                + scenario 5.1: B is a person who will feel
                  uncomfortable when B's location was known by other
                    -> B will not use this app

                    + Why B worries about their location?
                    - Because B can die any second if someone
                    want to kill B

    - Pros
    + Don't have to remember password
    + Short time to logged in
    + User Interface more simplify
    + Don't have password field <=> don't have register feature
    - mental heath pros:
    + Making our worry neuron cell become not worry neuron cell
    + Once we have not worry about things, we can do the things
    we want.
    + Was we do the thing we want make us happy?
    + We will not face the regret feeling
    + Once our strong mental neuron connected, no body can
    control us, we control ourself, our life

    + The thing is we want to know where our children been
    and don't have to remember the password because we
    have a lot of things to do to make this
    world becomes heaven = )), we don't have time to
    think a way to harm other for what.


    -> If somehow we can fix the (1) problem then
    we can remove the password field
      + How to loggin only use phone number field but
      the app still safe?

    -> Although we have a lot of negative things but
    let's try to see what happens

    -> Although we see that we have a really lot of
    negative things but let's try to do something
    to see what happens

    -> It is too dangerous for user, you do this will harm them, stop


  2. Common hand manipulation
  2.1. Mobile Phone
                         Phone
                         -----
                         |   |
 Comfortable position ___|___|___ Comfortable position
                         | o |    Touch the input field at first time
                         -----    when user put their finger on the phone


  2.2. Ipad

    touch right there  __|[]    []|__ touch right there
                         ----------
  3. Display Flag
  - Flow:
  + When user open the app, ask user to get the location
    + if user allow then display the flag corresponding the country
    + if user wasn't allow then what might happend ?
      + if display the USA(+1) country
        + sleep sapiens will see nothing
        + awake sapiens in another country may feel something bad
      -> So what we gonna do?
        + display blank rectangle? - temporary solution


  4. Display too much red color
  -> Don't display too much red color
  -> Display red color in stuff like: app name, logo

  5. App color
  - The color represent for Day work, night have fun, sync with solar system color
    + Day color for Day
    + Night color for night

  + Black color damage our pupil
    -> Decreasing the black opacity
    -> linear gradient color - use this

  6. The users use the app for kill somebody purpose
  6.1. war
  -> Just remove the app from the country
  6.2. random sapiens
  -> If a sapiens really want to kill somebody, there are a lot of ways to
  do.
  -> Learn privacy from Grab


II. User Interface
 + sign in screen
    + Logo
    + Name
    + Phone Number Input Field
    + Sign in button

 + dashboard screen

 + refer another app screen



III. Tech
1. Declare number/string/any-type value
+ Open app
+ Variables use memory to live
+ If variable have the same value then we should
point it to the same place to save resources

2. Import problem
2.1
+ On module A, import module B
+ On module B, import module A
-> Create infinity cycle import

2.2
+ On module C, import module A, B
+ On module C, export module A, B

+ On module A/B, import module C
-> Create infinity cycle import







IV. Todo
+ Replace all variables those have the same value by global variable
+ App name font famlily
+ onboard canvas


V. Tech note

1. Typescript
- *.d.ts file versus *.ts file versus *.tsx file

+ *.d.ts
  + Typescript declaration file
  + Typescript compiler scope
  + This file let Typescript compiler know
  if stuff was existed
  + Example:
    + We have
      function displayMessage(message) {
         alert(message)
      }
      outside the typescript compiler scope
      -> Typescript compiler cannot read this
      -> So we use *.d.ts to declare that
    + Example
      + on types.d.ts
        + write
          + declare function displayMessage(message:string);

+ *.ts file = standard file extension, it
will be compiled to Javascript

+ *.tsx file
  + React Typescript File
  + a *.ts file
  + written using JSX syntax

2. Typescript compiler
- parse *.ts file to *.js file
  + npx tsc file.ts

3. JSX
+ JSX: Javascript XML
+ JSX allow us to write HTML in React
- Example:
+ const element = <h1>I love JSX!</h1>


4. XML
+ XML: Extensible Marup Language
+ XML is similar to HTML, but without predefined
tag to use
+ In XML we define our own tags specifically
for our need
- Example:
<?xml version = "1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<message>
 <warning>
  Hello World
 </warning>
</message>

- more action -> virtual device manager -> start button

6. figma note
6.1. How to open web console
  + right click -> development -> open console

6.2. Integrate Figma Plugin With VS Code
  + ctrl + shift + B -> select tsc: watch - tsconfig.json.

6.3. Quick Open Plugin
  + ctrl + / -> plugin name

6.4. hidden layers + hidden right bar
- ctrl + \|


7. mysql note
7.1. MySQL Server Information
+ user: root
+ password: 1

7.2. Understand varchar(n) size
+ varchar(5) <=> "12345"
+ varchar(255) <=> a string which have 255 characters

7.3. Practise design
+ stuff_name varchar(size = ?)
  + Common stuff need to do string length is about 20 - 40,
  so size = 80 is okay

7.4. mysql shell note
+ \connect root@localhost:3306
  + connect to the database server

+ \disconnect
  + disconnect to the database server

+ this has few commands, use MySQL 8.0 Command Line Client instead

7.5. mysql 8.0 command line client note, mysql cli note
+ password: 1
+ after logged in, use mysql query language to query

+ show databases
  + list all database
+ status
  + show current working database
+ show tables
  + show all tables from current database that use;
+ describe `table_name`;
  + describe table structure like type, key, allow null
  + describe `users`;

7.6. compare 'fulltext search' versus 'like' tech
- temporary don't understand fulltext search
- temporary compare result is like > fulltext



8. Pure Javascript problem
+ It does not update immediately when use fetch
  -> event.target.checked value automatically change when click

9. Backend note
9.1. Octet
- Unit of digital information likes: computing, telecommunications
- symbol: o
- Example:
  + 1 o = 8 bits

9.2. Maximum domain length
- Might 255 octets
- 2040 bits = ? varchar

9.3. CORS
- CORS: Cross Origin Resource Sharing
- Summary: Allow/not allow another origin/domain/uri
access our application resouces/api

9.4. keyword of https://www.example.com
+ https: protocol/scheme
+ www.example.com: domain

- Origin:
  - Example 1: https://www.twilio.com
  + scheme: https
  + hostname: www.twilio.com

  - Example 2: https://localhost:5000
  + scheme: https
  + hostname: localhost
  + port: 5000

9.5.CSRF
- CSRF: Cross Site Request Forgery

9.6. My SQL Problem, mysql note
9.6.1. auto_increment, delete record not work
- Change auto_increment to code in vs code.

9.6.2. What is threads connect in mysql
  + Total number of client access to database server

9.8. CDN
- CDN: Content Delivery Network

9.9. revise foreign key knowledge

9.9.1. onboard java scenario
- users
   + contacts

- user send messages
  -> send to any phone number, not in the contact list
  -> don't use foreign key for this scenario

9.9.2. the first value of foreign key
- cannot insert new record if the foreign key does not match.

9.10. could not removed: g_unlink() failed error, save remove sql code,
save error

- no touch, just run the file

11. database note
11.1. 1m user do write/read records at the same time problem
+ Understand single thread
  + Do one stuff at a time.
  + What is the truth when 1m user do read/write records in the app?
    + 1m request to the Backend server -> 1m request to the database server
    +

+ Before good bye JS/TS test 1m virtual server request to access api
and check if the JS/TS can turn from single thread to multiple threads
  + Currently don't understand single thread, multiple threads


11.2. origins need multiple script cnd
- Understand the problem:
  + origin 1: https://stephen.com

    + random full uri : https://cdn-server-2.com/api/w3/file1.txt
    + random full uri : https://cdn-server-3.com/api/w3/file1.txt

  -> How to access cdn server when it uri is change usually?
     + Temporary solution: touch it database


  + step 1: Write backend api to send a array of full cdn uri
  for stephen app
    + step 1.1: design database schema to save route services
    coresponding origins
    + step 1.2: implement on backend code
  + step 2: on figma plugin developing, map it into script tags
  + step 3: append those script into plugin

11.3. Auto generate database script when app has new records
